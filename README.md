# Congress Cliques on Facebook

This 3D force-directed graph displays the mutually liked pages of American politicians on Facebook. The live graph is available at the following link: https://whimsical-speculoos-8e7417.netlify.app/ 

The graph shows a clear divide between Democrat and Republican relations on Facebook, as the majority of nodes are grouped with those of their own party. Politicians tend to mutually follow those of like-minded views, which can increase polarization and the development of echo chambers on social media. On the other hand, the visualization allows us to examine the outliers who cross partisan boundaries and follow members of the opposing party.
